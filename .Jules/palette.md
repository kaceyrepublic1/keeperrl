## 2025-10-26 - Information Hierarchy in Help Systems
**Learning:** Even a simple list of help topics can become overwhelming if not categorized. Adding section headers (e.g., "Mechanics" vs. "Encyclopedia") significantly improves the scannability of the UI, allowing users to find relevant information faster.
**Action:** Always consider the grouping and hierarchy of items in lists or menus. Use visual cues like headers, colors, or spacing to separate different types of content.

## 2025-10-26 - Completing "Invisible" UX
**Learning:** Placeholder text like "TBF" (To Be Finished) in user-facing documentation is a UX "debt" that creates a poor impression of polish. Completing these missing pieces of information provides a sense of delight by actually answering the user's questions when they arise.
**Action:** Scan for placeholder strings or incomplete data-driven content that might be hidden from the UI due to missing metadata (like icons or titles).
