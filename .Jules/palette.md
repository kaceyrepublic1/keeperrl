## 2025-10-27 - Help Menu Organization and Content Fixes

**Learning:** Grouping help topics using non-clickable headers improves discoverability and logical flow in data-driven UIs. Omissions in help content (like "TBF" placeholders or missing menu entries) significantly degrade the user's ability to learn core game mechanics.

**Action:** Always check for missing icons or incomplete strings in help files. Implement flexible UI builders that support grouping/headers to better organize growing lists of information. Headers should be carefully placed to group both scripted and hardcoded UI elements logically.
