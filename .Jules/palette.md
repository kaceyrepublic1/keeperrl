## 2026-02-04 - Help Menu Categorization and Fixing Missing Entries
**Learning:** Organizing the help menu with headers and fixing incomplete entries significantly improves discoverability and structure. In data-driven UI systems, it's crucial to handle edge cases like missing icons or IDs gracefully, either by skipping them or by rendering them as different element types (e.g., headers).
**Action:** Always check if there are "hidden" features or content that are defined but unreachable due to incomplete configuration, and use headers to provide visual hierarchy in long lists.
