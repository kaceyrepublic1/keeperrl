## 2024-05-23 - The Hidden Help Topic

**Learning:** An undiscoverable feature is a non-existent feature. The "travelling" help topic was completely hidden from users because it lacked an icon and a title in the help system's configuration. This highlights how critical it is to ensure every UI element has the necessary metadata to be properly indexed and displayed.

**Action:** In the future, when adding or modifying UI elements, I will double-check that they are correctly referenced in all relevant configuration files, including menus, help systems, and localization files. A feature isn't complete until it's accessible.
